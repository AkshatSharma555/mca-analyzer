üöÄ Getting Started (for Windows)
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher)

Python (v3.9 or higher)

Git

Installation & Setup
Important: You will need two separate terminals (like Command Prompt or PowerShell) open at the same time: one for the Backend and one for the Frontend.

1. Clone the Repository
First, open a terminal and clone the project from GitHub.

```
git clone https://github.com/AkshatSharma555/mca-analyzer.git
cd mca-analyzer
```
2. Backend Setup (Terminal 1)
Navigate to Backend Directory:

```
cd backend
```
Create Python Virtual Environment:
```
python -m venv venv
```
Activate Virtual Environment:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
(You should see (venv) at the start of your terminal prompt now.)

Install Python Packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create Environment File:

Create a new file named .env inside the backend folder.

Open the .env file and add the following line to run the full analysis:

DEV_MODE=False

Run the Backend Server:

```
python run.py
```

Your backend server should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Keep this terminal running.

3. Frontend Setup (Terminal 2)
Open a new, second terminal and navigate to the project's root folder (mca-analyzer).

Navigate to Frontend Directory:
```
cd frontend
```
Install Node.js Packages:
```
npm install
```
Run the Frontend Server:
```
npm run dev
```
Your terminal will show you a URL, usually http://localhost:5173.

4. You're All Set! üéâ
Open your web browser and go to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173). The application should be running. Remember, both the backend and frontend terminals must remain open.
